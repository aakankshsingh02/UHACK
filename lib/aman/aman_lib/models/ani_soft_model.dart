You can also edit videos. It is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.\n\nBeing a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems. It also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.\n\nWho uses Blender?\n\nBlender has a wide variety of tools making it suitable for almost any sort of media production. People and studios around the world use it for hobby projects, commercials, and feature films.\n\nKey Features\n\n"

It's a bit like Photoshop and its many alternatives since it's a raster image editor, but what makes it unique is its heavy focus on drawing, painting, and rapidly creating artwork. Unlike Photoshop, SketchBook isn't aimed at image manipulation or photography.\n\nInstead the app includes a wide range of tools aimed at artists and designers---from drawing and line-work tools, to brushes, textures, gradients, and blending modes. The app makes full use of layers, so you can group and rearrange various elements with ease.\n\nIn addition to the basics, SketchBook includes some more specialized tools. These include a range of guides and rulers, perspective guides, distort transform, brush blending, easy gradients, and a separate "
